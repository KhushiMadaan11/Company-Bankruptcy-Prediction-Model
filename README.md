# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction-Model

Predicting company bankruptcy is essential to reduce financial risks and assist stakeholders in their decision-making processes. This study develops a machine learning model aimed at distinguishing companies likely to go bankrupt from those that are not. It incorporates logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM to achieve high predictive accuracy using over 7,000 data entries and 10 key financial indicatorsâ€”such as Return on Assets, Operating Profit Rate, Cash Flow Rate, and Debt Ratio. The process includes data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory analysis to ensure prediction accuracy and reliability. This model provides valuable insights into factors impacting company stability and demonstrates the promising role machine learning plays in enhancing financial decision-making. Findings from this approach highlight primary financial ratios affecting solvency, reinforcing machine learning's potential in strengthening decision-making across sectors.
